    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta 
        but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
        I have found none better anywhere. 
        Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
        <li>3 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
     <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water.</li>
        <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. </li>
        <li>urn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes.</li>
